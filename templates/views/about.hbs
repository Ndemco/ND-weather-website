        <p>Greetings!</p>
        <p>My name is Nick DeMarco and I will be graduating from Western Connecticut State
            University with my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the end of this year (2020).
            I wanted to learn Node.js, but there are no Node.js courses at WCSU. I decided
            learn Node.js myself with the help of Andrew Mead's Node.js course on Udemy.</p>
            <p>This is my weather website that uses the "request" and "express" NPMs to gather
            data from the Mapbox global weather API and use that data to create a weather app.</p>
